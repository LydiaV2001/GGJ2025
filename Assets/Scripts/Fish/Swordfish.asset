  description: 'Swordfish are fast, powerful swimmers found in the Atlantic Ocean.
    They have long, flat bills shaped like swords, which they use to slash through
    schools of fish. These fish are skilled predators, feeding on smaller fish and
    squid. Fun Fact:  "Swordfish are like underwater ninjas! They can heat their
    eyes, making it easier to see in the dark, cold waters."'
