  description: " \"Sea urchins are like the hedgehogs of the ocean! They\u2019re
    covered in spines to protect themselves, but they\u2019re also essential for
    keeping the ocean floor clean. They play a crucial role in keeping kelp forests
    healthy by controlling algae growth. However, if there are too many, sea urchins
    can damage these ecosystems by overgrazing.\u201D"
