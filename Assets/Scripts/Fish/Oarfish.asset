  description: "\u201COarfish are long, ribbon-like fish that can grow up to 36 feet.
    They\u2019re known as the \u201Cking of herrings\u201D because of their huge
    size. These fish live in deep ocean waters and have a silvery appearance that
    helps them blend in. Oarfish eat plankton, floating in the water, and can be
    seen swimming vertically. Despite their size, they\u2019re not a threat to humans
    and are rarely seen.\u201D"
