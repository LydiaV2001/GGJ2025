  description: Pufferfish are quirky fish that puff up into a spiky ball when threatened.
    Found in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, many species have a powerful toxin
    inside them called tetrodotoxin, which is more poisonous than cyanide. Pufferfish
    are herbivores, eating algae and small invertebrates. Although dangerous, they
    are considered a delicacy in Japan, where only trained chefs can prepare them
    safely
