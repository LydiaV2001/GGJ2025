  description: "Anglerfish are deep-sea predators that use a glowing lure on top
    of their heads to attract prey in the dark waters of the ocean. They are found
    in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. These fish are known for their large
    mouths and sharp teeth. Fun Fact:  Anglerfish females are the real stars\u2014they\u2019re
    much bigger than the males, who just latch on like a clingy roommate!"
