  description: "\u201CThe false boarfish is a deep-sea fish with a bright orange
    body and sharp, spiny fins. They live in the Atlantic Ocean at depths of 200
    to 1,000 meters, feeding on plankton and small fish larvae. Despite their name,
    they\u2019re not related to true boarfish\u2014they got the \"false\" part because
    they look similar, but are quite different. While not endangered, they are tricky
    to study due to their deep-water home.\u201D"
