  description: Dolphins are playful, social mammals that live in the Atlantic and
    other oceans. They are known for their acrobatics and intelligence, as well as
    their complex communication skills. Dolphins live in groups called pods and work
    together to hunt fish and squid. These creatures are not just intelligent but
    also have a strong sense of social bonds.
